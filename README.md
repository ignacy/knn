=== KNN algorith in ruby

This is designed to show how easy it is to use machine learning
algorithms. Ruby, which as a language has great
features (Enumerable, Iterators), allows us to demonstrate
and prototype this solutions easily. 

I'm not sure if some of machine learning problems,
aren't better suited for JVM or C++, but the design phase,
and probably useage for small sets of less expensive algorithms,
can be for sure faclitated with easy on ruby.
